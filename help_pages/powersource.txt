PowerSource

Used for giving electricity to switches, or to generate constant 0 or 1 signal to a device.
Mostly you want to connect your PowerSource to a Junction, then your Junction to Switches.
Use Switches for circuit variables instead of PowerSources if you can!

To create: "create powersource <name>"

Unique functions:
	on - turns on the electricity
	off - turns off the electricity

You can use these unique functions by typing "device <your powersource name> <on or off>"
