Junction

Junctions are usually used to duplicate signals. For example, you can connect your PowerSource to a
Junction, and then you can connect the Junction to all of your switches.

To create: "create junction <name> <output pin number>"

Junction devices have access to a special connectall function. With this, you can connect multiple devices
to your Junction at the same time.

To use this unique function, type: "device <your junction name> connectall <you device names separated by spaces>"
