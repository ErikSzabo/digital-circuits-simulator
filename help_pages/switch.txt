Switch

Used to simulate circuit variables. You can set your variables in your circuits with switches.
Switch won't work unless it's connected to a PowerSource (or to anything which provides 1 signal).

To create: "create switch <name>"

Unique functions:
    on - generate 1 on the output
    off - generate 0 on the output

You can use these unique functions by typing "device <your switch name> <on or off>"
